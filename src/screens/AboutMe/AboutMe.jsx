          I'm an entry-level software developer with a great passion for new challenges and partially done education at
          the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at South Ukrainian National Pedagogical University, named after K. D.
          Ushynsky.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though I do not have a lot of commercial experience, I'm constantly evolving by gaining new knowledge.
          This knowledge is related to computer science, web platform-specific technologies, as my primary interest, and
          practicing writing source code.
        </p>

        <p>
          In quite a short term, I've covered lots of areas related to software development due to personal mentoring
          with a mature software engineer. Mentoring guided me to design a self-improvement road map that helped me to
          avoid the wrong paths in self-education at an early stage.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy being outdoors, fishing, and designing tools that help me do my job more efficiently
          at my current place.
